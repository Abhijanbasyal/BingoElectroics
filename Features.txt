creating one component for table where it can detect the total column present in table and directly we can use it for all


rating and reviews flows----------------------------
now i get it how to do that reviews 
like we go to the certain product page and 
there we write reviews and then we post it and also while adding reviews there will be other customer reviews also present there.

and for loyalty points using the cart where we add certain product in the cart and calculating the total cart products loyalty points

for recommendation ai 

1)  Content-Based Recommendation Using Title Similarity
🎯 What it does:
When a user visits a product page, it shows a few similar products based on the title and description (no need for user login, cart, or purchase data).

🧠 How It Works:
Store all product titles/descriptions in your database (already done).

When someone views a product:

Fetch that product.

Use TF-IDF or sentence embeddings to compare it with other products.

Return the top 3–5 most similar ones.

🧪 Tools You’ll Use:
Python (for the AI logic)

Flask (simple API server)

MongoDB (your existing DB)

scikit-learn or Sentence Transformers (to calculate similarity)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

2) 🛍️ Related Products / “Customers Also Viewed”
When viewing a product, show:

Similar products by title/description

Same category/sub-category

Price range similarity

✅ Tech: Cosine Similarity (TF-IDF), FastText, or Sentence Embeddings
💡 Easy and effective.
